## Content of Repository

### Figures

Folder with the illustrations used in the manuscript.

### Models

Contains the description of the site-occupancy model in stan language that was used to analyse the info species data.

### R-figures

This folder contains all the R scripts that generate the graphics used in the manuscript.

### R-temporal-trends

This folder contains the R scripts used to calculate the temporal trends. Five different methods were employed to calculate trends from the info species data. The trends from these methods were compared to those calculated solely with BDM data. See MS for details.

### Review

Materials prepared for the expert assessment of the calculated trend.

### Tables

- Appendix_Species-List.xlsx: A list of species with the number of records, spatial coverage, and reporting types.
- results.csv: A table containing the results of the various trend calculations.

## Data availability

The raw species records data are protected by a code of conduct common to BDM and Info Fauna but may be obtained upon request (see [BDM](https://www.biodiversitymonitoring.ch/) and [info fauna](https://www.infofauna.ch/)). BDM data are also available from butterfly monitoring schemes ([eBMS](https://butterfly-monitoring.net/) ). Species records data of Info Fauna at a coarser spatial resolution are available from the [GBIF database](https://doi.org/10.15468/atyl1j).

## Acknowledgements
The Swiss Federal Oﬃce for the Environment ([FOEN](https://www.bafu.admin.ch/en)) kindly provided the BDM data and supported the development of the Swiss Butterfly Index. We are greatly thankful to all project managers, experts, and naturalist, who provided species data to the [info fauna](https://www.infofauna.ch/) database and the dedicated team who conducted the fieldwork for the [BDM](https://www.biodiversitymonitoring.ch/index.php/en/). We thank Luna Sartori for valuable help in data provision.
